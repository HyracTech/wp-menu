Things i indentified

When trying to create a js file in /library/www/html/iiab-menu/menu-files/js#  called hyracbox-iiab-menu.js,
i kept getting an error

 [ Error reading lock file ./.hyracbox-iiab-menu.js.swp: Not enough data read ]
 
 but when i reduced the name length to hyracbox.js i din't get the error any more.
